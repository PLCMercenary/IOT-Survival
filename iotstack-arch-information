# PLC and ICS are crappy and old

    CREATED: [2020-03-15 Sun 04:13]

since Controls guys usually arent doing development like this, most of them
really dont have much experience with dockers or even testing environs since the
IDE&rsquo;s are preconfigured and only work with very specific controllers

Ok SO PLC dudes, I get it.. your laptop works, you have your software
activations and you know what you need to do to be effective, that means serial
cables, USB to DB9 connectors, a wireless router, and electrical type tools. ill
bet most of you are well versed with VM&rsquo;s??, proably have at least an XP vm
maybe even a win server 2K vm ??

well

A container can be a vm. but the best way to see it, is as 2 different types of
vm, either machine containers or applicaiton containers. The two containers
that we will be using in this project are LXC (pronounced LEX-SEE or even Lexi
if that helps) with LXD (also LexDee or Lexi with a D) and Docker Containers.

LXC instances are for all intents basically Virtual Machines with an entire
linux OS at your disposal. Yes. Linux is a big driver of the softmarket and has
become very much something that is a part of your toolkit

Docker containers are not whole OS&rsquo;s but they are a crafted environemnt that
only runs what is necessary, only the parts of an os or system that are needed
for a single application to execute.

So one LXD can run many dockers. One Docker is made to run one applicaiton,
1 docker for NodeRed, another for InfluxDB, and still another for Mosquitto
Broker.

# Docker Dashboards

    CREATED: [2020-03-15 Sun 05:22]

-   Since Docker is essentally a wrapper for a partial OS or some set of system
    services, they can be a bit confusing to interact with when they are running.
    this is why there are seveal third party applications that give dashboards and
    gui interfaces for docker.
    
    Cockpit is a great dashboard, Docky is a command line tool that makes your
    terminal look crazy awesome.

-   The IOT stack includes a docker called Portainer. this gives a web interface
    to all of the docker containers on your pi and proably the most important to
    get working right away.
